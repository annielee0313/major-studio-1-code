## Sketch 1: Colors and Pairings

**Visualization:** A mix of a color wheel, radial bar chart, and chord diagram to explore orchid bloom colors and their pairings.

**Research Question:** What colors are most common in blooming orchids, and are there frequent color pairings?

**Data: ~**2135 rows  ****`orchids AND bloom characteristics AND Living botanical specimens AND online_media_type:"Images"`  

Bloom colors will be extracted from the "bloom_characteristics" field, with exact shades identified using Vibrant.js.

## Sketch 2 **Pollination Syndrome and Fragrance**

- Orchids are often used in perfumes because of their diverse scents, which can range from sweet and lemony to musty.
- Orchids only give off scent when pollinators would normally be around in the orchid's natural habitat. For example, If an orchid in nature is pollinated by a nocturnal butterfly, it will smell at night.

**Visualization:** This project explores the relationship between orchid fragrance and their pollinators, focusing on how orchids release fragrance at specific times, either during the day or night, depending on whether their pollinators are nocturnal or diurnal. The network chart groups orchids based on shared pollinators and fragrance characteristics. A toggle feature allows users to switch between "Day" and "Night" modes, revealing how fragrance timing aligns with pollinator habits.

**Research Question:** How does the timing of orchid fragrance correlate with the activity patterns of their pollinators, and are there observable patterns in fragrance types across different orchid species?

**Pollination Data:** 649 rows `Orchids AND Fragrance AND Pollination Syndrome AND online_media_type:"Images" AND object_type:"Living botanical specimens"`;

- some does specify only (at night) e.g. https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:ofeo-sg_2007-1278C?fq=online_media_type:"Images"&fq=topic:"Orchids"&q=pollination&record=41&hlterm=pollination&inline=true
- Add a **toggle for day & night** â†’ fragrance & pollinator nodes only become visible when night mode is on?
- color coded scent?
