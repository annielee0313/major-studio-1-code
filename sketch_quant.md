# Quantitative Project Sketches
### Sketch 1 Bloom Time and Life Form
This visualization populates the northern hemisphere with bubble thumbnails of the orchids by filtering different months and life form (epiphytic, terrestrial, and lithophytic). You can toggle between the different life forms and see them comparatively, hover over the thumbnails to learn more and add those you want to see in a separate, exportable list. I envision this as a tool for visitors to explore the different kinds of orchids they would be able to see at different times (if there is an exhibition happening or anywhere in the northern hemisphere).

**Research Question** How do bloom times vary between epiphytic, terrestrial, and lithophytic orchids throughout the year? Is certain life form more seasonally dependent than others?

**Dataset** 1562 Rows with _bloom time_ out of 3512 total Orchid Rows `Orchids AND bloom time AND online_media_type:"Images" AND object_type:"Living botanical specimens"`;

**Data Cleaning** → bloom months are noted as “February to July” I need to clean it so the computer can recognize it as all the months in between. I also have to make sure there are no repeating objects.
