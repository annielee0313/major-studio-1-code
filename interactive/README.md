## Interactive Ideas

### 1. Combine viz 1 & 2 
Combine quant and qualitative projects 
→ three filters total: pollinators, fragrance, and month
maybe remove image background → add blooming animation

### 2. Orchid Hybridization 
Orchid growers select two parent orchids with desirable traits and use a toothpick to pollinate one with pollen from the other. The resulting hybrid will have traits from both parents. 
I want to imagining the ideal orchid for each pollinator. (e.g. flies like unpleasant scents, bees can’t see the color blue). 
I can feed midjourney the average life form, stem length, bloom width, number of flowers to get ai generated orchids. Also analyze the taxonomy to create a breakdown of existing types of orchids?

### 3. Location + filter by bloom characteristics
Visualizing rare and beautiful orchids around the world 
filter by box plot to see outliers maybe?
